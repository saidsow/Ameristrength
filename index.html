              Hi, my name is Cris McCullen and I’m the founder of Ameristrength Fitness.
              As a kid, sports and physical activity were my life.
              I started getting into resistance training when I was 16 and fell in love with powerlifting,
              bodybuilding, and nutrition. In fact, I loved it so much that I went to school for it and got
              my bachelor’s in exercise science. I wanted to pursue physical therapy but the family took
              precedence. I switched careers and became a firefighter/paramedic which I enjoyed but was not
              my passion. However, it gave me the priceless experience to become my grandmother’s in a home
              nurse for the last 7 months of her life. After her death I knew I had to get back to what god
              put me on this earth to do and these
              are the pillars for which Ameristrength Fitness was built upon.

             I have a minor in Dance and Psychology. I have been blessed to teach at Mercy Hospital, after-school programs, dance studios, New York sports club, Wellness centers and assisted living facilities. 
             I teach various fitness modalities including dance fitness, Zumba, HIlT training, cardio kickboxing, and self defense. 
             Due to years of training and experience in law enforcement I plan to add to the versatility at AF fitness with classes like Zumba, self empowerment/ defense, and boxing circuit classes.

                    <p>I was an avid gym enthusiast before. Over the years I had seen Cris train his clients. His
                      attentive nature called to me. I didn’t really want anyone involved with my workouts but I decided
                      to give them a chance because I wanted to change my split, gain more muscle, and see if I could
                      improve my training regiment. It was the best decision I ever made! Cris’ vast knowledge of
                      exercise
                      science, his attention to my fitness needs, and life-coaching spirit really made our sessions
                      worthwhile! He is a natural leader and completely changed my fitness physique. I was already in
                      great shape but this pushed me over the edge toward muscle gain and a new better body type. Cris
                      pushes me to work out harder than I ever did before and also provided me with different knowledge
                      than just simply working on my own!! He’s the best. I highly recommend him.</p>

                      connect with his clients on another level. Cris motivates me every day to become the best version
                      of
                      myself physically and mentally. I look forward to every workout. He tailors each session to my
                      personal needs and challenges me with new and exciting workouts that have transformed my body.
                      Cris
                      shows me the correct way to perform each movement and gives me the motivation and confidence to

                      pushing myself. He has also taught me about mindset and keeping a positive attitude for which I am

                    <p>I’ve had a number of good personal trainers over the years but none as skilled is Cris with whom
                      I’ve been training for over two years. His knowledge of body mechanics and nutrition is vast; yet
                      he
                      is always seeking a deeper understanding. At 70 I still want to train with intensity, and Cris has
                      helped me do it safely. My joints are in better condition than they have been in years because of
                      his program of alternating between heavier weights and lighter weights with high volume. Though
                      I’m
                      not a novice, Cris reins me in from injuries I might cause when following my own ego. His
